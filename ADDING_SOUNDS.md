# Adding new sounds
New sounds are welcomed, both to **add** different sounds or to **replace** the existing ones to improve them.

Before adding them, the soundclips must pass a criterion:
* **Appropriate license:** their licenses must let us use the clip. Those are licenses such as `CC BY (SA)` and `CC0`. If the sound is yours, there's no problem; we will always inform the authorship.

* **Ogg Vorbis format**
# Where to put the soundclips
The soundclips are all under [`assets/sounds/`](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/blanket/tree/master/assets/sounds/) directory with `.ogg` file extension, `Ogg Vorbis` encoding format.
If your sounds passed the criterion, you can add the sounds in your cloned local repo, at the specified directory, and the Pull Request to the main repository.
